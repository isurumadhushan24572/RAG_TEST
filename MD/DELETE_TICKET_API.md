## üß™ Test the Endpoint

### Create and Delete a Test Ticket

```python
import requests

API_URL = "http://localhost:8000"

# 1. Create a test ticket
test_ticket = {
    "ticket_id": "TEST-DELETE-001",
    "title": "Test ticket for deletion",
    "description": "This ticket will be deleted",
    "category": "Testing",
    "status": "Open",
    "severity": "Low",
    "application": "Test App",
    "affected_users": "None",
    "environment": "Development",
    "solution": "Will be deleted",
    "reasoning": "Testing delete functionality",
    "timestamp": "2025-10-27T12:00:00Z"
}

# Upload test ticket
print("üì§ Creating test ticket...")
response = requests.post(f"{API_URL}/api/v1/tickets", json=test_ticket)
print(f"‚úÖ Created: {response.json()['message']}")

# 2. Verify it exists
print("\nüîç Verifying ticket exists...")
response = requests.get(f"{API_URL}/api/v1/tickets/TEST-DELETE-001")
print(f"‚úÖ Found: {response.json()['ticket']['title']}")

## üéì Integration Examples

### Delete Multiple Tickets

```python
import requests

tickets_to_delete = ["TKT-001", "TKT-002", "TKT-003"]

for ticket_id in tickets_to_delete:
    try:
        response = requests.delete(f"http://localhost:8000/api/v1/tickets/{ticket_id}")
        if response.status_code == 200:
            print(f"‚úÖ Deleted: {ticket_id}")
        else:
            print(f"‚ùå Failed to delete {ticket_id}: {response.json()['detail']}")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"‚ùå Error deleting {ticket_id}: {e}")
```

### Delete with Confirmation

```python
import requests

def delete_ticket_with_confirmation(ticket_id):
    # First, get ticket details
    response = requests.get(f"http://localhost:8000/api/v1/tickets/{ticket_id}")
    
    if response.status_code == 404:
        print(f"‚ùå Ticket {ticket_id} not found")
        return False
    
    ticket = response.json()["ticket"]
    print(f"\nTicket to delete:")
    print(f"  ID: {ticket['ticket_id']}")
    print(f"  Title: {ticket['title']}")
    print(f"  Status: {ticket['status']}")
    
    confirm = input("\nDelete this ticket? (yes/no): ")
    
    if confirm.lower() == 'yes':
        response = requests.delete(f"http://localhost:8000/api/v1/tickets/{ticket_id}")
        print(f"‚úÖ {response.json()['message']}")
        return True
    else:
        print("‚ùå Deletion cancelled")
        return False

# Usage
