    "title": "Payment API Returning 500 Internal Server Error",
    "description": "Payment processing API is throwing 500 errors for all transactions. Error started approximately 30 minutes ago. Logs show 'Database connection timeout' messages. All payment requests from mobile app and web portal are failing. Customer complaints are increasing rapidly.",
    "category": "API Issues",
    "status": "Resolved",
    "solution": "**Immediate Mitigation:**\n1. Check application logs: `kubectl logs -f deployment/payment-api -n production --tail=100`\n2. Verify database connectivity from API pod: `kubectl exec -it payment-api-pod -- ping database-host`\n\n**Root Cause & Fix:**\n1. Database connection pool exhausted due to spike in traffic\n2. Increase connection pool settings in application.properties:\n   - `spring.datasource.hikari.maximum-pool-size=50` (was 20)\n   - `spring.datasource.hikari.connection-timeout=30000`\n3. Scale API pods horizontally: `kubectl scale deployment payment-api --replicas=5 -n production`\n4. Restart API service: `kubectl rollout restart deployment/payment-api -n production`\n5. Monitor pod status: `kubectl get pods -n production -w`\n\n**Verification:**\n1. Test API endpoint: `curl -X POST https://api.company.com/v1/payments/test`\n2. Check error rate in Grafana dashboard\n3. Verify database connections: `SELECT count(*) FROM pg_stat_activity;`\n4. Monitor application metrics for 15 minutes\n\n**Prevention:**\n- Implement auto-scaling based on CPU/memory metrics\n- Set up connection pool monitoring alerts\n- Add circuit breaker pattern for database calls\n- Regular load testing to identify bottlenecks",
    "reasoning": "The 500 errors with 'Database connection timeout' messages indicate the application's database connection pool was exhausted. This typically occurs during traffic spikes when all available connections are in use and new requests cannot acquire a connection within the timeout period. The sudden onset (30 minutes ago) suggests either a traffic surge or a resource leak. Since this is affecting all payment transactions, it's critical to both increase the pool size and scale the API horizontally to handle load.",

    "description": "S3 upload failures for large files.",
    "category": "Other",
    "status": "Resolved",
    "solution": "To resolve this critical incident, follow these steps:\n\n### Immediate Actions to Mitigate Impact:\n1. **Notify Affected Users:** Inform users about the ongoing issue and provide an estimated time to resolution to manage expectations.\n2. **Temporary Workaround:** If possible, suggest alternative methods for uploading smaller files or provide a temporary storage solution until the issue is resolved.\n\n### Diagnostic Commands/Queries:\n1. **Check S3 Bucket Configuration:** Verify the S3 bucket's configuration, especially the timeout settings and any specific policies that might affect large file uploads.\n2. **Monitor Application Logs:** Analyze the Upload Service application logs to identify patterns or specific error messages related to the upload failures.\n3. **Network and Resource Monitoring:** Use cloud monitoring tools (e.g., AWS CloudWatch) to check for any network issues or resource bottlenecks that could be impacting the upload process.\n\n### Fix Implementation Steps:\n1. **Implement Chunking:** If not already in place, implement a chunking mechanism to break down large files into smaller, more manageable pieces for upload. This reduces the impact of timeouts and network issues.\n2. **Add Retry Logic:** Develop and integrate retry logic with exponential backoff to handle transient failures during the upload process.\n3. **Update Timeout Settings:** Adjust the timeout settings for S3 uploads to accommodate larger files, ensuring that the upload process has sufficient time to complete without timing out.\n4. **Optimize Resource Allocation:** Review and adjust the resource allocation (e.g., instance types, bandwidth) for the Upload Service to ensure it can handle the demands of large file uploads.\n\n### Verification Steps:\n1. **Test Uploads:** Conduct thorough testing of the upload functionality with large files to verify that the issue is resolved.\n2. **Monitor Logs and Metrics:** Closely monitor application logs and cloud metrics to ensure that the changes have not introduced any new issues and that upload successes are consistent.\n3. **User Feedback:** Solicit feedback from users who were previously experiencing issues to confirm that the problem has been resolved.\n\n### Preventive Measures:\n1. **Regularly Review Configuration:** Periodically review S3 bucket configurations and application settings to ensure they are optimized for current usage patterns.\n2. **Automated Testing:** Implement automated testing for upload functionality as part of the CI/CD pipeline to catch any regressions early.\n3. **Monitoring and Alerts:** Enhance monitoring and alerting to quickly detect any future issues related to file uploads, allowing for prompt action to mitigate impact.\n4. **Capacity Planning:** Regularly assess the capacity needs of the Upload Service to ensure it can scale appropriately with growing demands, including the ability to handle larger files and increased traffic.",
    "reasoning": "The likely root cause of this issue, based on the symptoms of S3 upload failures for large files, is related to timeout issues during the upload process. This is similar to Past Incident 1, which had a 95.9% match confidence. The large file size is likely causing the upload to exceed the default timeout threshold set for the S3 upload operation, resulting in failures. Other potential contributing factors could include network instability, insufficient resources (e.g., memory, bandwidth), or misconfigured retry logic and chunking mechanisms within the Upload Service application.",
